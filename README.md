# RedirectorJS
A simple js script to redirect websites to their privacy friendly &amp; ad free frontends

## Current supported websites:

* Youtube -> invidious
* Instagram -> bibliogram
* reddit -> libreddit (optional)
* wikipedia -> wikiless
* google translate -> simplytranslate
* twitter -> nitter
* imgur -> rimgo

And more coming soon

## Problems

The script doesnt actually block the domains before redirecting, which may or may not be an issue for you. A simple way to fix this is to for e.g place youtube.com in your adblock.

This script doesn't randomise instances in order to prevent too much traffic going to a single instance. I doubt that many people are going to use this, so it shouldnt be an issue.

## Supported Platforms

**IOS:** via hyperweb, and entering this url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t3dium/RedirectorJS/main/Redirector.js (with reddit redirect) or https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t3dium/RedirectorJS/main/Redirector(without_reddit_redirect).js (without reddit redirects) in the custom scripts section.

**Desktop:** with greasemonkey, violentmonkey, tampermonkey etc.
